# Joystick Visualization Plugin

This is a plugin for Rocket League (BakkesMod) which shows you how the game registers your joystick inputs.

This plugin improves upon [Joystick Self-Check](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/54) [(Source)](https://github.com/kcolton/JoystickSelfCheckPlugin) from @AlpacaFlightSim by allowing more settings.

Hope it's some use to you. Enjoy!

  - Has a cool freeze-frame feature when jumping (great for practicing speedflips and such)
  - Looks better (cool color-coding)
  - Just use it instead of this one... :)
